## 🌿 Plant Disease Prediction Using Deep Learning

### 🔍 Introduction
Plant diseases significantly reduce agricultural yield and quality. Early detection and accurate classification are critical for implementing timely interventions. Leveraging deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enables automated, efficient, and scalable disease diagnosis from leaf images.

---

### 📊 Objectives
- Develop a deep learning model to classify plant leaf images as healthy or diseased.
- Integrate the model into a web-based application for real-time predictions.
- Optimize performance using transfer learning with lightweight architectures like MobileNetV2 or EfficientNet.

---

### 🧠 Methodology

#### 1. **Data Collection & Preparation**
- **Sources**: Public datasets (e.g., PlantVillage, Kaggle).
- **Processing**:
  - Resize images for uniformity.
  - Apply `split-folders` to separate data into training, validation, and test sets.
  - Use augmentation (rotation, zoom, etc.) for generalization.

#### 2. **Model Selection**
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilize pre-trained models like MobileNetV2 and EfficientNet.
- **Fine-tuning**: Replace final layers with custom classifiers suited to plant disease categories.

#### 3. **Training & Evaluation**
- **Platform**: TensorFlow with GPU support via Anaconda environments.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
- **Visualization**: Confusion matrix, training/validation loss and accuracy curves.

#### 4. **Web Application Integration**
- **Framework**: Flask for backend + HTML/CSS for frontend.
- **Functionality**:
  - Upload leaf image.
  - Model inference and disease diagnosis.
  - Display result with user-friendly feedback.
